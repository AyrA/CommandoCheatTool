# Levels

This contains a list of all levels.
Levels marked as "trivial" are those where you simply have to walk from left to right.

This doucment contains spoilers for secrets.

## Level 3: Jungle 1

The first level. Nothing special about it.

### Completion

Trivial

### Guns

- Gauss Pistol (secret)

### Secrets

In the first section with the water, there's an invisible springboard wedged in the ground between two rocks.
Using this allows you to get the gauss pistol.

A second secret can be found later by trying to stay on the ground.
There's a wall that forces you to take a path above via the trees.
The wall contains a secret, but withot any guns.

## Level 4: Mine 1

A level that plays underound.

### Completion

Requires the key to continue. To get it, drop down the elevator shaft.
Walk right towards the second shaft and land on the elevator itself.
Jump left from there and keep walking left as much as possible.
Your allies will burst through a wall and hand you the key.
Then go back to the elevator. You must loop around it from the bottom
because you cannot jump back up the last ledge you dropped down.
Try to get on top of that elevator again, then go to the right.

### Guns

- None

### Secrets

After dropping down the very first elevator shaft,
there's a red pipe in the roof when going right.
Left to this pipe is a piece of wall sticking out from the roof.

At the very bottom of the mine you can walk through a wall on the left of a metal floor
that has a grenade below it. The entry to the secret is a wall piece behind a stack of boxes.

## Level 5: Storage

This is a level that loops back on itself.
The second time you go through it the path will be different though.

### Completion

Go up the elevator shaft. Grab the uzi on the branch in front of the storage facility.
Walk through the storage facility until you get to the top right.
An airstrike will open the roof once you try to enter the room,
which allows you to get roof access and walk left on it to drop down a hole.

In the room you fall into, stand on the button to open all doors.
Now go through the facility again but stay on the bottom this time.

Be careful, the airstrike can in fact kill you. The bombs drop randomly.

### Trivia

In this level you will find for the first time enemies with a red cap on.
Under the right circumstances, explosions turn them into bricks.
An explosion that's strong enough will immediately blow up said brick too.
You can see this as the enemy not only exploding into bones, but also metal fragments.

### Potential problems

The airstrike that blows a hole in the room on the top right is random.
This means under some rare circumstances it will not explode all metal pieces of the shelf.
If those prevent you from getting to the roof, try to blow them up using grenades.
Because they're meant to be blown up, the grenade should stick to it.

### Guns

- Uzi
- Laser Pistol (secret)

### Secrets

Do not go up the first elevator shaft, instead walk through the wall on the right.
Inside of the secret room, you can walk through another wall on the right to get the laser pistol.

The second secret is also right at the start.
Inside of the storage facility, go to the very top left.
You can walk through the wall on the left and jump on a tree branch to get some points.
The jump is somewhat difficult though due to the small clearance.

## Level 6: Jungle 2

Another jungle level, but with a support character

### Completion

Walk to the right until you can go up the first tree.
Go to the left to get the gauss pistol. Then continue to the right
until you find your support character. Be careful,
there's barbed wire on one branch.
Continue heading to the right until your support falls off a bridge.
Going further to the right you have to deal with a boss fight.
A tank will fire shells at you that you have to dodge,
then a person peeks out on the top and fires his machine gun at you.
When you hit that person with any gun the cycle repeats.
After 3 cycles the tank explodes and you can go down through the hole that the exploding tank made.
Go to the left to get your support character, then go to the right to end the level.

Note: In the first cycle the tank fires 3 shells, then with each cycle it increases by one.

### Trivia

You can stand on the tank. Shots it fires into the sky can come back on random occasions.
Rarely it fails to explode the bridge far enough for you to get back up.
In that case, you have to reload.

### Guns

- Gauss Pistol
- Minigun (secret)

### Secrets

The first secret is in the very first hole you get to after meeting your support character.
Drop into the hole and hug the left wall to enter the secret.
In the secret room, there's some goo in the ground that kills you on contact.
On the shelf is the minigun. I don't know how to reliably pass over the goo,
but keeping the jump button pressed occasionally allows you to jump instead of dying.
If you do die, it costs you two lives.
This is the first secret to reveal a custom image.

A second secret is in a wall by the bridge.
When you arrive at the bridge, simply walk back to the left again.
There's a wall you can walk through.

## Level 7: Airport

A level with yet another miniboss.
The first level with strong enemies that take 8 shots instead of 4 to kill them.

### Completion

Go to the right and down with the elevator.
Continue to the right, then climb up.
You will have to fight the person next to the helicopter.
Get the keycard after the fight, then get back to the elevator.
You can now open the door on the left by waling into it. This gets you the rifle.

### Trivia

This level has the only item (the elevator) you activate manually with the arrow keys.

### Guns

- Rifle

### Secrets

At the vers start is a springboard in the ground when you walk left.
Do not continue to walk left midair because you could accidentally exit the level.

The wall to the left of the guy you have to fight contains a secret.
In the top of the watch tower with the button
you can exit through the wall on the left and jump on the roof of the inital building.

## Level 10: Desert

The first level of the second chapter.
This introduces you to enemies with AK-47, a gun you can never obtain.

### Completion

Trivial

### Guns

- Uzi
- Laser Pistol

### Secrets

The wall to the left of the laser pistol can be walked through.

## Level 11: Military Storage Facility

This level has a "Z" shape and has you spend a lot walking to the left

### Completion

Trivial

### Guns

- Gauss Pistol
- Rifle
- Shotgun (secret)

### Secrets

When you're walking to the right again on the lower level in a section marked "B" on the wall,
you can walk into the second transformer from the right to obtain the shotgun.
Getting out of this secret can be a bit difficult.
Watch closely where you drop down to know where exactly to get back up again.

## Level 12: Train

This introduces you to the suicide bomber.
they try to run towards you as fast as possible, and then detonate.

### Completion

Trivial at first. The flamethrower is at the very start of the level.
At the end is a boss fight. Shoot the helicopter until it falls from the sky.
When it does, it blows out the front of the train cabin and you can enter it and get to the chest.

###Trivia

Standing on the tip of the train allows you to shoot the helicopter but avoid its gun.

### Guns

- Flamethrower

### Secrets

None

## Level 13: Refinery

This level contains oil pools that are deadly unless you have the boots.
This level has a secret that shortcuts the regular path you should take.

### Completion

Go up in the first building and cross the bridge.
Be careful because two suicide bombers will spawn behind you once you're at the end of the brige.
In the second building, find the minigun at the very left of the first floor.
Press the button at the very top of the second floor.
Go back down. Between the second and third building, climb up the tanks and pipes.
Keep climbing. At the top right are the boots you need.
Go back down, pass through the remaining buildings to the very right of the level.

### Trivia

In this level you collect the boots that allow you to walk through oil pools.
The item is removed when you complete the level, and when you die.
When you die after getting the boots you must get them again,
even if the user interface suggests otherwise.

### Guns

- Shotgun (secret)
- Minigun
- Gauss Rifle (secret)

### Secrets

In the very first building you can walk to the left wall on the top floor.

In the second building, you can exit through the wall in the top right of the room with the button.
If you jump when exiting you should land on a small platform with the shotgun on it.
Doing this also bypasses the first part of the climbing section.
You must later get down through that section,
so it's still advised to kill the enemies at the bottom first.

The third exit can only be obtained with the boots.
Simply walk through the oil pool in the second building.
There will be a second oil pool.
You can enter this pool and walk to the right to obtain the gauss rifle.
This is the second secret to reveal a custom image.

### Level 14: Crash Site

This level supports another support character you get to very early in the game.
It also relies more on the strong enemies.
This is also the first time you get to fight against people in mecha suits.
Be aware that they're immune to explosions.
The gauss rifle and grenades do nothing.

### Completion

Trivial until you get to your support character.
The two guns will be next to the exploded tank that's just before you meet him.
Follow him until he stops moving, at that point continue alone through the rest of the level.
At the end you cannot exit. Instead you have to walk backwards a bit.
Your support will have moved up to the crash site and end the level and chapter for you.

Your support character will not say anything when he eventually just stops moving.
This is normal, just continue alone.

### Trivia

The rifle and minigun occupy the same area.
You will only see the minigun but pick up both.

### Guns

- Rifle
- Minigun

### Secrets

On top of the first hill right after your support character stops moving is a hidden hole in the ground.
The hole is to the right of the barbed wire.
Inside of the secret seems to be another sectret at the bottom right wall.

Be careful. This secret apears to not have been properly finished
and is almost impossible to leave again due to faulty ceiling placements in the hill section.

## level 17: Ice

Serving as the first level of the chapter, naturally it contains many guns

### Completion

Trivial

### Guns

- Gauss Pistol
- Uzi
- Rifle
- Shotgun

### Secrets

At the bridge, walk left towards the barbed wire to fall through the ground.
You can visit the area under the bridge, but you cannot escape, and nothing is here.
This is likely an incomplete secret.

After the bridge eventually comes a small hill with a few bits of barbed wire on the left of it.
The rightmost tile of barbed wire is a dud.
Below is a springboard that allows you to skip the mountain and an enemy.
This is another secret that reveals an image.

## Level 18: Air Base

This is the first level where explosive damage works against mecha suits

### Completion

Trivial

### Guns

- Minigun
- Machine gun (secret)

### Secrets

You will eventually pass through a building where you find the minigun and exit at the top.
To the left of the exit is a wall you can walk through, and then another one.
This gets you the machine gun.
Sadly only half a level before you can get it in an obvious manner.

Between the last two of three towers with air defense on them you can enter the wall on the left.
Exiting is possible again with the springboard.
Sometimes requires multiple attempts, and is generally easier when facing right.

## Level 19: Mecha Assembly Facility

The exit condition of this level is that you kill 3 officers.
The order is irrelevant. The completion guide gives you the most streamlined method.

Note that this level completely lacks checkpoints.
You always have to begin from the start when you die.

### Completion

Go right from the start and grab the machine gun if you did not get it in the previous level.
Then drop down the first hole to the right.
To the very bottom left will be the first officer you have to elliminate.
Your guy will announce when he gets him.

The next officer will be in a room that's directly above the hole you dropped down.
There will be no announcement for killing him.

The third officer is further to the right. Go right until you can get up again.
He will be on top. Yor guy will announce that you killed them all.

The end sequence will be at the very right of the map.
This is also where you find the rocket launcher.
Grabbing the rocket launcher is mandatory.

You will fight a large number of enemies,
but also have support characters flooding in from the left.

### Guns

- Machine gun
- Rocket launcher

### Secrets

You can walk below the platform of the 3rd officer into the grey wall.

## Level 20: Rocket Launch Facility

This level features the most complex setup with two boss fights,
and an additional timed fight scene. It also has unique music.

### Completion

Go to the right to get to the first fight scene and use the rocket launcher against the enemy.
The pattern is always the same. He will fire a volley of grenades at you,
then jump one platform towards you.
After a short delay he fires a few rockets at you, then jump another platform towards you.
At this point the pattern repeats.
To avoid the rockets, simply jump over them but not with maximum height
because he fires the rockets a bit too fast for this and will eventually hit you.
After a few rounds of this you should beat him.
Your team will come and destroy the turrets below the platforms, allowing you to continue.

You eventually arrive at the next boss fight.
He will take your rocket launcher during the fight if you try to use it.
If you don't he will take it afterwards, and no, you're not getting it back.
That short lived fun that device was. Just use the machine gun for maximum efficiency.

After beating him, drop down to the floor and go to the right.
This will start a timed sequence on an elevator. Just kill everything left and right.
The gauss rifle is particularily effective in this situation.

Eventually the elevator will move you to the top floor again. Go to the left and the level ends.

### Guns

None

### Secrets

None

## Level 21: Rocket

This is the last level and consists of a single bossfight

### Completion

Simply beat him again. He has more health this time.
Being to the right side of him tends to be easier.

After you beat him, the game ends.
Note that this fight isn't on a timer either.
You have as much time as you want.

### Trivia

If you use the cheat tool to give you the rocket launcher back he will take it again.

### Guns

None

### Secrets

None
